# Brazillian-Electoral-Analysis-2017

This repository contains produced data and reports by students Ilan Grynszpan and Debra Legge (Flinders University of South Australia) during the final sememster of 2017. Using computer programming with languages R and Python, the studies aimed at researching the Twitter performance of the main pre-candidates for the Brazillian Presidential Elections of 2018 at that time. As such, the study, as hereby presented, is divided in two main parts: The first consists at finding possible correlations between the candadites' performance on social media and they're numbers at the polling plataforms (namely, here, DataPoder360). The second part aims at investigating the Three best polling candidates at the time, João Dória (PSDB-SP), Lula (PT-SP) and Jair Bolsonaro (currently PSL-RJ), and correlating with the use of hashtags #Doria2018, #Lula2018 and #bolbonaro2018 throughout the state and federal capitals of Brazil.
